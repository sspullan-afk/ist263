        <h2>Senior at Syracuse University Studying Data Analytics</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Steven Pullano. I’m an Applied Data Analytics major at Syracuse University and I’m interested in leveraging the technical skills that I’ve learned thus far to solve real world business problems throughout my career.</p>
        <p>A few notable things that I’ve accomplished in my years at Syracuse are building an end-to-end ETF prediction program using different machine learning techniques to accurately produce results, participate in case studies centered around information security, and learn how to efficiently and effectively utilize visualization tools in R to convey important messages in my data.</p>
        <p>Outside of work and school I love to ski, golf, and have good times with friends. I’ve been skiing since I was 4 years old and have gone to mountains all across the US and Canada to find the most challenging ski runs I could. I only started golfing at the end of high school, but throughout the years I’ve gotten better and it’s a great way to relax and spend a few hours with friends outside. I’m excited to dive into my senior year and take in as much as I can while making sure I enjoy the last few months of my college career.</p>
